# Multi-Alarms

Multi Alarms is a Java GUI (using Swing) to show a series of alarms (one per row)
that can be set to run simultaneously.

Each alarm counts down and plays a configured sound to alert the user.

## Background
I wrote MultiAlarms in 2003 for a cinema projectionist
who needed to run multiple alarms (up to 5) at a time in order to keep track of
which cinemas needed to have reels attended to.

I then found it generally useful but it lay forgotten in the source code cupboard of my machine
as I moved on to other things.
So I've created this GitHub repository for it, for posterity.

### Build
The MultiAlarms.jar in dist dir works (I just tried it on MacOS and I used to use it on Windows)

But I've started changing the source directory structure from what was an old JBuilder project,
from memory.

So this needs some more fixing up and to use some kind of build process.
I haven't been in the Java world for some time, so this will take some effort.

I will get to this when I can and anyone interested in helping is very welcome.
